                        <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 18px;">
                            The Greek terms techne and logos, when transliterated, are the origin of the word technology. Techne is the Greek word for art, skill, craft,
                            as well as the method or process by which something is acquired. The Greek term logos translates as "word," "utterance," "saying," or "expression".
                            Today's technology has fundamentally altered the way we live, work, and communicate. A few instances of how technology has grown significantly and
                            provided our society options never before possible include smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality.

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 18px;">
                            Technology plays the most important role in the development in any sectors like Computer science, electronics, telecommunications, engineering, 
                            and healthcare are among its many subfields. It also covers a wide variety of industries and fields.

                            As you know everything in this world has both pros and cons, so technology has also both pros and cons. So we are here to talk
                            about the pros of technology. As you know technology is the most reliable thing in the current situation of the world.
                            Most of the work is done in technology as it is the most reliable thing and we can trust the processes done by technology.
                            As you know technology has increased the availability of information. Technology has made it easier to gain information through the internet.
                            Technology has helped many people to communicate from one place to another place. With the help of E-mail, messaging apps, and video conferencing,
                            people can communicate in real-time wherever they live.</p>
                            <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 18px;">
                             As technology is being developed, medical advancement is also being increased.
                            Technology has improved in the field of medicine making the way for the treatment and cure of diseases. The Internet helps in education as we can 
                            get any information that we are confused about. Technology is so important in today's world as without it we cannot know anything that is happening
                            around the world as we people depend on technology. So in today's world, technology is very essential to do everything. Without it, we are not able to do anything as the world is being 
                            developed along with technology.

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 18px;">
                            As you know most people are now dependent on technology, so most of them rely on technology for any work as we can find them through
                            the internet. The rise of technology has decreased face-to-face communication. When people can get anything with the help of technology, people
                            feel more disconnected from their communities and more alone. The overuse of everything leads to addiction, so does technology. When people are 
                            addicted to technology, they spend most of their time on technology and neglect their social life and their friends and family. As technology
                            is increasing rapidly, electronic device manufacturing and disposal can have a big negative effect on the environment, causing pollution and climate change.
                            When using electronics websites, we need to share our information to get access to the website as that increases our data privacy as they can use 
                            it for their benefit. People love to spend time with technology as they are addicted to the device. They neglect their healthcare as they spend all their time
                            on phones and playing games whenever they get time instead of doing exercise, as a result, they fall sick due to unhealthy hygiene. So technology being
                            developed is good, but we should not make it our priority. As technology keeps improving, we should also improve in ourselves.

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 18px;">
                             As you know technology is the most important factor in the development of everything, so technology has also made an impact on the development
                             of the camera. When taking pictures in low-light conditions, cameras may have built-in flashes or the capability to use external flashes  which 
                             help us to click pictures at night time. The data acquired by the image sensor is processed by the image processor, the "brain" of the camera. 
                              It can do tasks including noise reduction, color correction, and image compression. The lens must direct light toward the camera's sensor.
                             To enhance image quality and lessen distortion, modern lenses frequently feature intricate arrangements of several parts. The camera's image sensor is
                             the electronic part that captures light and transforms it into digital data. The majority of digital cameras have an autofocus system that uses sensors
                              to determine how close a subject is to the camera before correctly adjusting the focus. High-quality photos and movies can be easily taken thanks to technological advancements,
                              and digital cameras' ease of use and convenience have been significantly improved.</p>
